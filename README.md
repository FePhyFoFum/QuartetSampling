# Quartet Sampling #
Quartet Sampling is a method to analyze molecular phylogenies by calculating branch support using repeated sampling of quartets.  Quartet Sampling differs from other support methods by combining a set of of tests into a single, efficient framework to address phylogenetic discordance.  QS is particularly useful for very largv and data-sparse aligmments or large phylogenomic datasets.

## Requirements ##
* RAxML: precompiled and you probably want the threaded version
* Python 3 is recommended (but is compatible with Python 2.7)

## Usage ##

See the manual for Quartet Sampling (coming soon).
